## What is Sass?
Sass is a CSS precompiler that adds additional developer tools that make your code more scalable, organized and easier to read. If you're wanting to install Sass, please use the guides linked as a reference.

## Helpful Links

## What you'll find
In this repo I've included a "unsolved" and "solved" version of creating more DRY code using Sass. 

## How to run?
1. Git clone this repo to your folder then run ```'npm install'``` in your terminal.

2. To get the Sass Compiler to watch and update your CSS files
run ```npm run compile:sass``` in your terminal

Sass will automatically compile into your styles.css file once there's a new change. Only make changes in the scss files!
